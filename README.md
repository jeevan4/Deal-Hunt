Mini Project 1: Interface component

The Main Activity loads all the deals from an XML file. Once an item in the list is selected, the deal will be opened in a different activity with the deal item image, description and a button that redirects to the deal link.

This project deals with the followign features :

1. Download the XML file from a given URL
2. Parse the downloaded XML file and load the data into an activity using ListView.
3. Load an ImageView with a Image file that is fetched from an URL.A circular progress bar will appear if the image is
   being downloaded. ( Used Universal Image Loader library (https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader))
4. Navigation from one activity to other.
